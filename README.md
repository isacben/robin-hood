# Robin Hood

Robin Hood is a platformer video game. It is my entry to the JS13KGAME game jam 2023, with the topic 13th Century.

Today I finished the implementation of the player's movement and its animations.

Kontra.js has a pretty neat and easy to use system to setup a sprite sheet and create animations for every state you need for your character!

The movement with the animations took me a bit more than a couple of days, because I also had to draw the sprites, but I am really happy with the result!

I feel I will be able to implement the game play pretty fast after this.

8 days have past, and I just have the bare bones of my game! I was moving, so I didn't have much time to work.

At least, I have the idea and a project to build from: it will be a platformer where you are Robin Hood, taking money from the rich to give it to the poor, while you fight the guards!
